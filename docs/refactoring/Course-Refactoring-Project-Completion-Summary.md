## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Transformation

### Before Refactoring:
```
Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository
     ‚Üì
Monolithic Service
Mixed Responsibilities
No Caching
Basic Error Handling
```

### After Refactoring:
```
Controller ‚Üí QueryService/CommandService ‚Üí Repository
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì
   CQRS Pattern   Domain Events
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì
   Redis Cache    Event Bus
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  i18n Support   Monitoring
```

## üîß Technical Enhancements

### 1. **CQRS Implementation**
- **CourseQueryService**: Handles all read operations with caching
- **CourseCommandService**: Manages write operations with business validation
- **Clear Separation**: Improved maintainability and scalability

### 2. **Caching Strategy**
```java
@Cacheable("courses")
public CourseDetailsResponse getCourse(String slug)

@CacheEvict(value = "courses", key = "#slug")
public CourseDto updateCourse(String slug, CourseRequest request)
```

### 3. **Domain Events**
```java
@EventListener
public void handleCourseCreated(CourseCreatedEvent event)

@EventListener  
public void handleCoursePublished(CoursePublishedEvent event)
```

### 4. **Internationalization**
```java
// MessageService for centralized i18n
public String getMessage(String key, Object... args, Locale locale)

// Enhanced exceptions with message keys
throw new BadRequestException("course.validation.invalid_price", price);
```

### 5. **API Documentation**
```java
@Operation(
    summary = "Create new course",
    description = "Creates a new course with the provided details...",
    requestBody = @RequestBody(...)
)
```
