# Course API Release Notes - v2.0

## Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. CQRS Implementation
The Course service has been split into Command and Query operations with improved separation of concerns.

**Impact**: No API endpoint changes, but improved performance and caching.

### 2. Enhanced Exception Handling
All exceptions now return standardized error responses with localized messages.

**Old Response Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "ERROR",
  "message": "Course not found"
}
```

**New Response Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "ERROR",
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Course not found",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Action Required**: Update frontend error handling to check for `code` field.

### 3. Improved Course Slug Handling
Course slug update logic has been optimized:
- If `slug` is provided in request, use it as-is (don't auto-generate from name)
- If no `slug` provided, generate from name
- Automatic uniqueness validation

**Impact**: More predictable slug behavior for frontend forms.

## New Features ‚ú®

### 1. Internationalization Support
Full i18n support with Vietnamese and English languages.

**Usage**:
```http
GET /api/v1/courses?lang=vi
# or
GET /api/v1/courses
Accept-Language: vi
```

**Supported Languages**:
- `en` (English) - Default
- `vi` (Vietnamese)

### 2. Enhanced Caching
Comprehensive caching system implemented:

**Cached Endpoints**:
- Course details: 1 hour
- Course existence checks: 30 minutes
- Courses by category: 15 minutes
- Course metadata: 1 hour

**Performance Impact**: Significant reduction in response times for read operations.

### 3. Domain Events
Asynchronous event processing for course lifecycle:

**Events Triggered**:
- Course status changes
- Course submission for review
- Course creation/updates

**Impact**: Better integration capabilities and audit logging.

### 4. Improved Permission System
Enhanced permission validation with clear business rules:

**Delete Permissions**:
- Admin/Staff: Any course without active enrollments
- Instructor: Only owned courses without enrollments

**Modify Permissions**:
- Instructors can only modify courses in DRAFT or REJECTED status
- Admin/Staff can change course status

### 5. Course Status Workflow
Formal status transition system implemented:

**Status Flow**: `DRAFT ‚Üí PENDING ‚Üí PUBLISHED/REJECTED`

**New Endpoint**:
```http
POST /api/v1/courses/by-id/{id}/submit-for-review
```

## Performance Improvements üöÄ

### 1. Database Query Optimization
- @EntityGraph annotations eliminate N+1 queries
- Optimized joins for course details
- Lightweight projections for list operations

**Expected Improvement**: 50-70% reduction in database query time.

### 2. Response Time Optimization
- Strategic caching implementation
- Reduced payload sizes for list endpoints
- Optimized serialization

**Expected Improvement**: 30-50% faster API responses.
